# Shopping List
This is a sample project to create a shopping list app for Android.

### Features
One screen with
- one text input field with one button near it, to add items
- one shopping list with the added items, each with a delete button that removes it

The items should be preserved between app starts.

### What's important
We just want to see how you move around the IDE, how you structure your code, 
how you choose and use frameworks and libraries, and how you think in general. 
No need to implement all features. We'll come up with questions along the way.
